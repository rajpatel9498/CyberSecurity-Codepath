#Pentesting
Time spent: 3 hours spent in total

Objective: Identify vulnerabilities in three different versions of the Globitek website: blue, green, and red.

The six possible exploits are:

Username Enumeration
Insecure Direct Object Reference (IDOR)
SQL Injection (SQLi)
Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)
Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)
Session Hijacking/Fixation
Each version of the site has been given two of the six vulnerabilities. 
(In other words, all six of the exploits should be assignable to one of the sites.)
